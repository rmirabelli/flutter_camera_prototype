A new Flutter project.

## Tasks for 8/30 - 9/1

- √ Camera and gallery via package
- √ permissions for both platforms
- permissions on a screen BEFORE buttons appear
- √ save images to local directory
- √ resize images if larger than set size
- √ browse saved images (maybe even build a script to allow this, but it's just for me...)
- √ rename saved images
- ? create a file naming said saved images (just read the directory?)
- √ gallery
